			<h3>Dino Finder</h3>
			<div class="imgDiv"><img src="images/DragonFinder.png" alt="Screenshot of Dino Finder Website"/></div>
			<p>DinoFinder is an object-orientated PHP project, styled with SASS, that fetches and displays information about different dinosaurs, from a MySQL database.
				<br>I worked on this project with a team of people working in Scrum, my main roles involved working on implementing Hydrator classes and their associated SQL queries as well as assisting with Unit Tests and contributing to design decisions.

			<h3>Word Nerd</h3>
			<div class="imgDiv"><img src="images/WordNerd.png" alt="Screenshot of Word Nerd Website"/></div>
			<p>Word Nerd is a JavaScript web application (based on Wordle) that encourages users to guess a five-letter word, within six guesses, providing feedback along the way.
				The project includes a words.json file that can be customised to add or edit five-letter words of your choice.
				<br>I worked on this project with a team of people working in Scrum, in this project I created a function that dynamically generated the tiles and assigned them css classes to represent whether or not they were correct letter guesses. I also worked on the event listener that handled how the game ran including a guess counter and validation/sanitisation on the text entry.

			<h3>Job Listing Website</h3>
			<div class="imgDiv"><img src="images/jobListing.png" alt="placeholder"/></div>
			<p>This mock Job Listing Website was a team project that we developed in React.js using SCSS stylesheets to work from and implement an existing design and wireframe.
				<br>In this project we used an API that was provided to us to query a DB of jobs and assorted information about them. The features I helped develop for this project was the search functionality that utilised an API fetch as well as triggering a conditional render that decided what information was displayed to the user on the front end.
